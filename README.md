# COSMOS2020: Manifold Learning to Estimate Physical Parameters in Large Galaxy Surveys

This is the repository of the code used in [Davidzon et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06373) 
to measure redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate of photometric galaxies. 
The code is based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and is trained/calibrated using the [COSMOS2020 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13923).

Every Python (3.6) file in the repository contains self explanatory comments. For any question please contact iary.davidzon@nbi.ku.dk.
This project has been funded by the European Union’s Horizon2020 research and innovation program, under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant
agreement No. 896225.
